# Research 

Our group has a broad research program in flavor physics with active work in Lattice QCD, neutrino phenomenology and leptogenesis. Members of the group also carry out research in cosmology and fundamental physics. While we have a strong theoretical component to our research, some of us are involved in large collaborations in neutrino physics (Euronu) and cosmology (SDSSIII).
